# Webpage to see the timeline of your life
The web page has been developed for information purposes to see how long a person is still alive. Set to 85 years as the average age. The goal is to visualize how far you have come and how much is yet to come.

Project made after I was inspired by a person who showed that your life really isn't long. With this you are able to see how short it actually is and how well you should enjoy your short time on this earth.

## What technology uses the webpage?
The web page uses react. React was used as this is a very useful framework to create an interactive user-friendly web page. For the rest I also used Mui for some components.

## How do I use the wbe page?
- Install nodejs on your computer. Install chocolatey right away in the installation.
- After installation, download the latest release of the project and extract this folder to a certain path.
- Next refer to the directory in your terminal.
- When you are in the directory you are ready to start the web page with the following command: npm start
- You are ready to use the web page. (localhost:3000)
